This is my repository for the project 1 in Exploratory Data Analysis. The goal of this project 
is to examine how household energy usage varies during 2007-02-01 to 2007-02-02 via constructing
plots using the base plotting system. 

The repository contains 

  1) 4 separate R code file, plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R for the construction of the 4

     png figures.

  2) Each R code file has the code for downloading and reading data. They also include the code 

     for creating PNG files.

  3) 4 png figures plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png.

Data for the project are from:
